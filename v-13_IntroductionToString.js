//A string is a collection of characters enclosed in quotes. In JavaScript, you can use either single quotes or double quotes to create a string.

let name = "junaid"; //we write string in this way
let surname = 'attar'; // we can also write sting in this way
//let wrongstring = " wrong way '; // this is incorrect way to write the string

// if we want to convert any number ex-"7" into string we can change the type of value in string by using - toString();

let a = 7;
a.toString();
console.log(typeof(a)); //typeof is to identify data type
                        // output --->>> string
//by this way we can change the number value into the string value
