//A string is a collection of characters enclosed in quotes. In JavaScript, you can use either single quotes or double quotes to create a string.

let name = "junaid"; //we write string in this way
let surname = 'attar'; // we can also write sting in this way
//let wrongstring = " wrong way '; // this is incorrect way to write the string
