  /* advantages of inline script-
                                 1]quick add logic:-you can add quik logic in inline script,you dont have to 
                                 write seprate script for small script

                                 2]No need for additional file:-By writing code inside the script tag, 
                                 you don't need to create an additional file, which can make your project
                                  easier to manage

                                 3]Inline scripts are executed immediately:-When the browser encounters an
                                  inline script, it will execute it immediately. This can be useful for scripts
                                  that need to be executed before the rest of the page is loaded. 
    
    advantages of external script-
                                  1]1Separation of concerns:- By referencing an external source file, you
                                   can separate your JavaScript logic from your HTML markup. This makes it
                                   easier to maintain and update your code.

                                   2]Caching:- When a user visits your website, the browser will cache any external JavaScript files that are referenced. This means that if the user visits your website again, the files won't need to be downloaded again, which can improve the page load time.

                                   3]Code reuse:- By referencing an external source file, you can reuse your JavaScript code across multiple pages of your website. This can save time and reduce the amount of code you need to write.
